## User Flow

### Meta

Status
: Work in progress - **Done** - Obsolete

### Goal

The goal of this evaluation is to determine the optimal user flow through our app.

### Method

We presented our application to family and friends and observed their navigation through the app, gathering feedback along the way.

### Results

One common critique was the inconvenience of being redirected back to the product backlog page after creating a new ticket for the sprint view or editing a ticket within the sprint view. Users expressed frustration at having to navigate back to the sprint view and select the appropriate sprint where the ticket was created.

### Implications

Based on this feedback, we made adjustments to our code to improve the user flow of the app.
