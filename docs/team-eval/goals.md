## Collective:
We're aiming for a very good grade.

## Vasco:
I want to learn as much as possible about web developement. Furthermore, I want to test if web developement is something I want to pursue after my studies.

## Nicolas: 
I want to get better at programming with Python and I'm looking forward to explore this new software stack.
