## Nicolas

### My observations

- very structured
- diligent planning and staying on schedule
- communicated well (fast answers via text)

### Effect on me

- motivated me to not do things last minute too
- (more so effect on the group): we never went behind schedule
- the planning process (which I always find hard) was very structured and efficient
- When I was working on the project and had something I wanted to check with Nicolas he was very quick to answer I thus didn't loose any time waiting for his reply

### Tip for the future

- nothing to note
