## Vasco

### My Observations

- Highly structured
- Very ambitious and motivated
- Easy to communicate with

### Effect on Me

- Normally I tend to postpone tasks to the end, but Vasco made sure that we have an organized schedule with regular meetings throughout the semester that kept me motivated to deliver and show him what I managed to achieve since the last meeting.
- The communication between us was always based on respect for each other and very concise.

### Tip for the Future

- Continue working like this.
