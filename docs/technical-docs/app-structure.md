### Product Backlog Implemented Version
![Product Backlog 2.0](/SCRUM_Webapp_Project/assets/images/Product_Backlog.png)

### What has changed
- As you can see we have completely changed our Product Backlog design compared to what we thought it would look like in the conception phase
- Instead of a table with each task being a row, it now is in the same design as the Sprint View
- We have four columns each representing a different phase
- During these phases the first idea of a feature or task is refined and made ready to be in a sprint

### What has changed
- On this route not that much changed
- We still have 4 columns
- The first column is now named differently
- The selection of sprints now is done with a navigation bar similar to a radio button instead of a drop down menu
- The columns are not framed anymore but are kind of free floating
