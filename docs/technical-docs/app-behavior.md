# App behavior

When users visit the site for the first time, they are presented with a login page. On this page, they have the option to either log in or register. Clicking on the "No Account yet? Then register here" button forwards the user to the register page. After filling out all the fields and pressing "Register," the user is greeted with a flash message confirming that the account has been successfully created. They are then prompted to enter their login credentials.

Upon successful login, the user is welcomed with a greeting message and presented with the option to navigate to the product backlog or the sprint view. On the product backlog page, users have the option to create a ticket.

When creating a new ticket, users are required to provide a title and a description before being able to proceed. Additionally, they can choose whether the ticket should be placed in the product backlog or the sprint view. Users can also specify a workload in hours, add notes, and assign the ticket to a registered user. Upon submitting the new ticket, users are redirected to the appropriate page.

Users are also able to edit a ticket. In this view, they are presented with a similar interface, with the addition of a delete button at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on the delete button triggers a confirmation popup with the warning "Are you sure you want to delete this ticket?" Pressing "OK" deletes the ticket permanently.
